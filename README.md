Machine Learning-Based Mood Classification in Music

Our goal is to classify music based on four moods. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: we will first use the API to fetch data from Spotify and perform thorough data preprocessing, including data normalization, outlier removal, and data denoising. After cleaning the data, we will leverage several machine learning methods, such as random forest and deep neural networks, to build models for data classification
